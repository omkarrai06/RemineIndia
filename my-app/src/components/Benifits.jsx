            <li>Conserves natural resources: Recycling reduces the need for raw materials, such as timber, water, and minerals, which helps to conserve natural resources and reduce the environmental impact of resource extraction.</li><br></br>

            <li>Saves energy: Recycling often requires less energy than producing new products from raw materials. This helps to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy production.</li><br></br>

            <li>Supports the economy: Recycling creates jobs in the recycling industry and can generate revenue from the sale of recycled materials. This helps to support the economy and promote sustainable development.</li><br></br>
