                <p className='' >E-waste, also known as electronic waste, refers to discarded electronic devices such as computers, mobile phones, televisions, and other electronic equipment. E-waste can contain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can be harmful to human health and the environment if not disposed of properly.

                Li-batteries, or lithium-ion batteries, are a type of rechargeable battery commonly used in electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Li-batteries are known for their high energy density, long lifespan, and low self-discharge rate. However, they also have a limited lifespan and can become a source of e-waste when they are no longer usable. Li-batteries also pose a potential environmental hazard due to their flammability and the toxicity of some of their components, such as lithium cobalt oxide. Proper recycling and disposal of li-batteries is important to prevent environmental contamination and reduce the amount of e-waste.
